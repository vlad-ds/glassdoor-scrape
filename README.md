# Glassdoor Job Scraper

This script will allow you you scrape jobs from Glassdoor according to location and job title. 

You need to insert your Glassdoor email and password in the env file. You may have to hide this file (simply rename it from "env" to ".env"). 

The code works for me at the moment. I cannot guarantee that it will work indefinitely, as the Glassdoor site may change. 

I've also included the json with my search results and a notebook with my analysis.
